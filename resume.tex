		\item {Improved the algorithm that processes the status of the hotels given their devices\textquotesingle{} parameters, reducing 95\% of the processing time.}
		\item {Implemented a solution to centralize the communications with all the different property management systems (PMS). With it, we got rid of duplicate code that we had in multiple platforms that need to interact with hotels.}
